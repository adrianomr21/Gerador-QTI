## Project Overview

This project is a web-based tool for generating QTI 2.1 packages for multiple-choice questions. It consists of a single HTML file (`Gerador_Qti2_1_v17.html`) that contains all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and package the QTI content.

The tool allows users to input questions and answers in a simple text format, and then it generates the corresponding XML files and packages them into a ZIP file that can be imported into a learning management system (LMS) that supports the QTI 2.1 standard.

The key technologies used are:
*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript
*   [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) for creating ZIP files.
*   [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) for saving the generated ZIP file.

## Building and Running

This is a single-file web application. To run it, simply open the `Gerador_Qti2_1_v17.html` file in a web browser. There are no build steps required.

## Development Conventions

The code is written in a procedural style within a single HTML file. There are no specific coding style guidelines or testing practices evident from the code.
